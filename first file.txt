This is my first text file submitted using GIT and not github

Now I have added some more text

This change has been written on a local computer.

Now I am going to add another local line. Push it remotely and then I will create a branch on github and see what hapenns then.

The following lines have been added in a new branch on GITHUB.

I will commit these lines and see how it is dealt with locally!

I have this installed on my local PC and have added these lines to this document. Git stated that it has created a new local branch but I thought it would track the remote branch?????
